# Water flow detection and measurement using microcontrollers for Precision Agriculture
## For AMTDC KITE Internship 

The objective of this project is to research on the mechanism that is required to build a water flow meter, using  the Hall-Effect Mechanism. To understand the hall-effect mechanism, basic knowledge of electromagnetism is required, as well as knowledge on how electricity and magnetism are interrelated.

## Summary
Throughout the duration of the internship, I learned about a lot of new topics ranging from working and construction of water flow meter, different types of sensors, batteries and microcontrollers. </br>
● During the duration of 3 months of the internship, I learned a lot of things by studying the water flow meter. I also learned about the hall effect , hall-effect sensor and worked on creating a prototype using this knowledge.

● Throughout the journey, I faced many challenges which helped me learn various new concepts. The hall-effect sensor works when the distance from the magnet is less than 0.4cm. Due to that, the positioning of the sensor is a tougher task. Since the sealing of the sensor, to avoid contact from the water is also considered,  positioning and sensitivity of the hall effect sensor are of utmost importance .

● This internship was a great opportunity for me to learn more about the real-life situation and helped me gain practical experience. I learnt how to work in a team. Sharing and having discussions helped me to overcome the challenges I was facing. The internship helped me learn time management , Critical Thinking, Perseverance, In-Depth Understanding and Problem Solving. 
The weekly sessions with the mentor helped me realise the solutions to my challenges and come up with creative ideas. The guidance of my mentor was a huge support.
